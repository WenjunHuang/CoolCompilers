Introduction to Classroom Object-Oriented Language Compiler Project

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the Classroom Object-Oriented Language (COOL) Compiler project! This project serves as a hands-on exercise for students and enthusiasts diving into the world of compiler principles. Here's what makes our project unique and exciting:

Educational Focus: Specifically designed to supplement learning in compiler theory courses, this project offers practical experience in understanding and applying compiler principles.

Targeted Language - COOL: Our project focuses on developing a compiler for the Classroom Object-Oriented Language. COOL is known for its instructional value in teaching the basics of programming languages and compiler construction.

Diverse Implementation Languages: What sets our project apart is the use of multiple programming languages for implementation. We've embraced the versatility of languages like Rust, C++, and Haskell, among others, to demonstrate different approaches and paradigms in compiler construction. This diversity not only enriches the learning experience but also provides a broad perspective on the compiler development process.

We invite contributors and learners to explore our code, offer suggestions, and collaborate to enhance this educational tool. Whether you are a student trying to grasp compiler fundamentals or a seasoned developer interested in language design, there's something here for everyone.

Stay tuned for updates, and happy coding!
